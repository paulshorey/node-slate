## TLDs Sort Order

**For use with our [domain suggestions API](#documentation)** - specify which TLDs you wish to support, promote, or demote. Specify how aggressively you'd like to promote each TLD by giving each a score. TLDs with a higher score will be sorted towards the top of the list. Low scores will be sorted towards the end of the list.

## Default TLDs

**For use with our [domain suggestions API](#documentation)** - specify which TLDs you'd like to use when the user's search term was too obscure, and did not yield any synonym-based or category-based related TLDs.
