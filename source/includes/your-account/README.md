# Your Account  
  
Coming soon! You'll be able to register your site, and configure options and preferences.  
  
For domain suggestions, you will specify which TLDs you support, which ones you want to promote, and how aggressively you'd like to promote them. You'll give each TLD a score - bigger score will float it higher to the top of the results.

## POST data to our server (coming soon):  
  
* **Create an account**  
  
  * You'll get back a `site_id` and a `secret_token`. The `site_id` is an optional parameter in our APIs.  
  
    You will pass the `site_id` when GETting data from our server. We'll use your custom data and preferences, instead of our own.  
  
    The `secret_token` you will not send in any public requests, but only in administrative API requests to manage your account settings. We're also working on an admin app to let you manage your settings without programming.  
  
* **Set options**  
  
  * Configure options and preferences, like the minimum/maximum length of suggested domain names, sort options, preferences, etc.  
  
  * Configure which TLDs your site supports, and which you'd like to promote  
  
* **View what options you have set**  
  
  * View your account info, and all configured options
