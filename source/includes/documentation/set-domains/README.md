# Manage Your TLDs

**This section is currently in development, and will be ready soon.** When you sign up with us, you'll get an "site_id" and a "secret_key". The "site_id" is public. You'll be able to pass it openly in any API call. It will tell our server to use your pre-defined settings. The "secret_key" is your password, required to modify your settings. You'll pass it to these API endpoints below, to manage your account. More options coming soon. [Contact us](javascript:document.querySelector('.eapps-form-floating-button').click()) with any questions or feature requests.
