## Word breaking (chunking)

**API coming soon.**

If your user inputs a string of characters, with no spaces, break it up into individual words, in order, and get info about each word - part of speech, singular/plural, entity extraction, etc.

**Demo: [NLP.Domains](https://nlp.domains).**

Try the demo app â†‘. Enter a long domain name with no spaces. We'll parse it into individual words, then suggest TLDs, synonyms, and word hacks based on those words.
