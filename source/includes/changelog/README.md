# Changelog  
  
## Current Version: "mvp"  
  
It stands for "minimum viable product". It is very much a work in progress. We are still adding features, and the API spec is changing.  
  
**  
But don't worry. **All changes will be backward-compatible**, meaning if you start using the API, you will only have to update your code if you want to gain the latest features.  
**  
  
No changes since the initial release.  
  
&nbsp;  
## Future versions  
  
The documentation will be updated. You will be able to read about each version of the API. You can always view each version of the API at [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/besta-domains/api/domain-suggestions-tlds). Previous versions will continue to be supported for many years.
